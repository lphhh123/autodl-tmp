I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on {problem} problem:
{problem_description}

Please consider is {problem} a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is a combinatorial operation problem response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

ANSWER IN FORMAT: ***is_cop:yes/no***
