Wafer-level chiplet placement (wafer_layout).
We assign each slot (chiplet/task segment) to a physical site on a wafer.
Objective is a weighted scalar of (normalized communication cost, normalized thermal cost)
plus penalties for duplicates and boundary violations.
A move operator modifies the assignment (swap / relocate / random_kick / noop).
