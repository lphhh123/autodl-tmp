Wafer-Level Chiplet Placement (wafer_layout)

We have S chiplets to place onto Ns candidate sites on a wafer.
A solution is an assignment: assign[i] = site_id, mapping each chiplet i to a site.

Objective is a weighted sum:
- Communication cost: based on traffic between chiplets and Euclidean distance between their assigned sites.
- Thermal cost: based on chiplet TDP and its radial position, with additional spatial spreading effect.
The final scalar objective is:
total = w_comm * comm_norm + w_therm * therm_norm
(lower is better)

Operators:
- swap(i,j): swap two chiplets’ assigned sites
- relocate(i,site_id): move chiplet i to a target site (if occupied, swap)
- cluster_move(i_list, site_list): set a group assignment
- random_kick(moves): a sequence of random swaps/relocates
