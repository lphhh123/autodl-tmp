# HeurAgenix (Wrapper Notes)

**IMPORTANT (v5.4 contract):** Baseline comparisons for v5.4 audits **must** be run via
`proj_ast2_ucf101_full/scripts/run_layout_heuragenix.py`. Running `launch_hyper_heuristic.py`
directly does **not** emit the required v5.4 trace/run_manifest evidence chain, and such
results should not be used for audit-grade comparisons.

If you need a standalone HeurAgenix baseline for debugging, use the direct launcher at your
own risk and do not mix those outputs with v5.4-tracked experiment results.
