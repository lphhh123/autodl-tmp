# A1 (dense baseline) - tuned to be a fair accuracy baseline while keeping
# training throughput manageable.
#
# Key idea:
# - Keep window retention for TRAIN to bound clip count
# - Use a larger window budget for EVAL to avoid missing the action segment
#
# NOTE: requires utils/data_ucf101.py support for *_train / *_eval keys.
